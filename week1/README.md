## 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Refactoring

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology.


## Use Case

A marketing agency wanted to refactor their website to make it more aceessible. An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web **accessibility** ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for business&mdash;for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website.

Refactoring should also take into consideration **TAM** which stands for "Total available Market" or "Total Addressable Market" to describe business opportunity associated with some action, product or service. Increasing your customer base represent larger opportunity to grow.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## CodeBase

Original Code is uplaoded to [Week1 Folder](codebase). The folder includes [original CSS](codebase/Develop/assets/css/style.css) and [original HTML file](codebase/Develop/index.html) and [original photos](codebase/Develop/assets/images)

## ModifiedCodei
